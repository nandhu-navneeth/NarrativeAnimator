## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke creativity and imagination. It is versatile and provides a sophisticated backdrop for a multimedia application.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a desaturated pastel of the primary color, for a soft, non-distracting background that maintains thematic consistency.
- Accent color: Vivid violet (#8A2BE2), analogous to indigo but with increased brightness and saturation to draw attention to important UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif that provides an elegant and intellectual feel appropriate for a narrative-focused application.
- Use minimalist icons, in the accent color, to represent actions.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout with ample whitespace.
